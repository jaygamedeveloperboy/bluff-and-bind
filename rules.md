# Bluff and Bind - Game Rules

## Overview
Bluff and Bind is a strategic card game where players compete to be the last one standing. The game combines elements of strategy, chance, and playful consequences.

## Basic Setup
- Players start with a number of tokens based on the chosen difficulty level
- Each round, players choose one of five possible actions
- The last player with tokens remaining wins the game

## Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: More starting tokens, gentler punishments
- **Medium**: Standard starting tokens, moderate punishments
- **Hard**: Fewer starting tokens, intense punishments
- **Extreme**: Minimal starting tokens, extreme punishments

## Game Actions
Each round, choose one of these five actions:

### 1. Attack 🗡️
- **Strong Against**: Submit
- **Weak Against**: Trap
- **Effect**: Standard win against Submit, standard loss against Trap

### 2. Defend 🛡️
- **Strong Against**: Attack
- **Weak Against**: Trap
- **Effect**: Standard win against Attack, standard loss against Trap

### 3. Submit 🙇
- **Strong Against**: Trap
- **Weak Against**: Attack
- **Effect**: 
  - Wins against Trap
  - Loses against Attack
  - **Special**: Winning with Submit grants a random perk!

### 4. Trap 🕸️
- **Strong Against**: Attack and Defend
- **Weak Against**: Submit
- **Effect**: Powerful against Attack/Defend, vulnerable to Submit

### 5. Wild 🎲
- **Effect**: 
  - Trumps all other cards
  - If played against Submit: Strong win (perk + higher punishment)
  - If played against Attack/Defend/Trap: Normal win
  - If both players play Wild: Both lose a token, get punished, and gain a random perk

## Card Mechanics
- Cards become locked for 2 rounds after use
- Wildcards can only be used once per game
- Each time a player loses two tokens, they must remove an article of clothing
- **Don't want to do a punishment?** You may choose to forfeit the punishment, but you must lose one token instead.

## Perks System
Perks are special abilities that can be gained in two ways:
1. Winning a round with Submit
2. Both players playing Wild in the same round

### Available Perks
1. **Control**: Force your opponent's next move
2. **Reverse**: Reverse the outcome of a round
3. **Trap**: Set a trap that activates on your opponent's next move

## Winning Conditions
- Be the last player with tokens remaining
- If all players lose their tokens in the same round, the game is a draw

## Tips for Success
- Pay attention to which cards your opponents have used
- Save your Wild card for crucial moments
- Consider the risk/reward of using Submit for perks
- Watch for patterns in your opponents' play styles
- Remember that losing tokens has consequences beyond the game!

## House Rules
- Players can agree on additional rules before starting
